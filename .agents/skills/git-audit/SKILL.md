description: Inspect a git repository's history using five commands that identify churn hotspots, contributor concentration, bug-prone files, delivery momentum, and firefighting patterns. Use only when the user explicitly invokes `$git-audit` or explicitly asks to run a git audit.

# git-audit

Use git history to build a diagnostic picture of a repository before opening implementation files. The purpose is not to replace code reading. The purpose is to decide where to look first and what risks to expect.

This skill is closely inspired by Ally Piechowski's article ["The Git Commands I Run Before Reading Any Code"](https://piechowski.io/post/git-commands-before-reading-code/) and adapts that workflow into a reusable skill.

## Invocation

Run only after explicit user invocation. Never auto-invoke for unfamiliar repositories, feature work, triage, or code navigation.

Do not use this skill as proof of code quality by itself. These commands provide signals, not verdicts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the commands:
1. Confirm you are inside a git repository.
2. Prefer the repository root so path output is easier to read.
3. If the repo is extremely large or a monorepo, interpret results with extra caution.
4. If useful, adjust the time window from `1 year ago` to match the repository's pace.

Basic repo check:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

## Workflow

Run the five commands below in order. After each one, interpret the output before moving on.

### 1) What changes the most

```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="1 year ago" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

What it shows:
- the most frequently touched files in the chosen time window

How to interpret it:
- high churn can mean active development, not necessarily poor quality
- high churn plus team fear is often a codebase drag signal
- the top few files are strong candidates for first inspection
- cross-reference the top 5 against the bug hotspot command below

What to say about it:
- call out likely hotspots, not just the top file
- note whether churn seems concentrated or spread out
- distinguish active product work from suspicious repeated patching when possible

### 2) Who built this

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges HEAD
```

Optional recency check:

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges --since="6 months ago" HEAD
```

What it shows:
- contributors ranked by commit count
- possible contributor concentration and maintenance handoff risk

How to interpret it:
- if one person dominates the history, bus factor may be low
- if historic top contributors are absent from recent history, handoff risk may be real
- compare lifetime contribution with recent contribution, not just one or the other

Important caveat:
- squash-merge workflows can make this reflect who merged, not who wrote the code

What to say about it:
- describe concentration carefully
- avoid overclaiming ownership from commit count alone
- explicitly mention squash-merge distortion if it may apply

## Monorepo de-noising

If raw churn is dominated by repository metadata, generated artifacts, or bulk-content paths, do a filtered second pass before deciding what code to read.

Treat these as likely noise unless the user is explicitly auditing build, release, localization, or docs workflows:
- lockfiles and dependency manifests
- changelogs and release metadata
- snapshots, generated files, coverage, dist, and build outputs
- bulk-content paths such as docs or localization trees

### Required heuristic

If 5 or more of the top 10 churn results are likely noise, rerun both churn and bug-hotspot analysis with excludes.

If the filtered pass is still dominated by bulk-content paths such as `docs/`, `locales/`, or `i18n/`, rerun once more with an additional repo-specific exclude and label it clearly as a runtime-focused pass.

### Directory-level triage

Use this when a repo is large enough that file-level hotspots are too noisy at first glance:

```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="1 year ago" | grep . | cut -d/ -f1-2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Filtered churn pass

```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="1 year ago" | \
grep -vE '^$|(^|/)(package\.json|pnpm-lock\.yaml|package-lock\.json|yarn\.lock|bun\.lockb?|CHANGELOG\.md|.*\.snap)$|(^|/)(__snapshots__|dist|build|coverage|generated|vendor)/' | \
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Filtered bug-hotspot pass

```bash
git log -i -E --grep="fix|bug|broken" --name-only --format='' | \
grep -vE '^$|(^|/)(package\.json|pnpm-lock\.yaml|package-lock\.json|yarn\.lock|bun\.lockb?|CHANGELOG\.md|.*\.snap)$|(^|/)(__snapshots__|dist|build|coverage|generated|vendor)/' | \
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Reporting rule

When you use a filtered pass:
- report the raw pass and the filtered pass
- explicitly name the excluded categories or paths
- say why the filter was necessary
- distinguish generic de-noising from any repo-specific runtime-focused pass

### 3) Where do bugs cluster

```bash
git log -i -E --grep="fix|bug|broken" --name-only --format='' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

What it shows:
- files most often associated with bug-related commit messages

How to interpret it:
- files appearing on both this list and the churn list are especially worth inspecting
- repeated bug-related touches can indicate fragile areas, unclear design, or missing tests
- weak commit-message discipline reduces the signal sharply

What to say about it:
- highlight overlap with churn hotspots
- call this a heuristic based on commit language, not a definitive defect map

### 4) Is this project accelerating or dying

```bash
git log --format='%ad' --date=format:'%Y-%m' | sort | uniq -c
```

What it shows:
- commit count by month across the repository history

How to interpret it:
- a steady rhythm often suggests consistent delivery
- major drops may correlate with staffing changes or priority shifts
- spikes followed by quiet stretches may suggest batch releases or crisis bursts
- this is team/process signal as much as code signal

What to say about it:
- describe the shape of the curve, not just the raw counts
- avoid simplistic judgments like "dead repo" without context

### 5) How often is the team firefighting

```bash
git log --oneline --since="1 year ago" | grep -iE 'revert|hotfix|emergency|rollback'
```

What it shows:
- visible crisis-related commits in the chosen window
- an empty result is meaningful here and does not automatically indicate a command problem

How to interpret it:
- a few may be normal
- frequent reverts or hotfixes can point to deployment instability, weak tests, or release-process issues
- zero matches can mean stability, or just vague commit messages

What to say about it:
- talk about operational confidence, not only code defects
- treat this as a pattern detector, not a precise metric

## Synthesis

After running all five commands, produce a short triage summary with this shape:

1. Top hotspots
   - which files appear risky or central
2. Ownership risk
   - whether knowledge looks concentrated or transitioned
3. Bug overlap
   - whether churn and bug language converge on the same files
4. Delivery pattern
   - steady, declining, bursty, or hard to tell
5. Firefighting signal
   - visible crisis patterns, ambiguous, or quiet
6. Where to read first
   - name the first few files or subsystems to inspect next

## Suggested response style

When using this skill, give the user:
- the exact commands you ran
- the key results, compressed into a readable summary
- caveats that materially affect interpretation
- a recommendation for what code to inspect next

Avoid:
- pretending these metrics are objective truth
- using churn alone as a synonym for bad code
- making personnel claims stronger than the evidence supports
- forcing certainty when the repo history is noisy or ambiguous
- reporting filtered hotspots without also saying what was excluded

## Common pitfalls

- Monorepo noise: lockfiles, manifests, snapshots, docs, and localization trees can dominate the first pass.
- Merge-strategy distortion: squash merges can hide true authorship.
- Commit-message distortion: vague messages weaken bug and firefighting signals.
- Time-window distortion: `1 year ago` may be too long or too short.
- File-path noise: renames and generated files can muddy hotspot counts.
